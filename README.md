# springmvc-hibernate-sandbox
* Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
* CRUD operations on customer entity using spring MVC + Hibernate

# Spring configure
* [Use these files](https://github.com/ranjithkumarravikumar52/springmvc-starter-files) to jump start the configuration
* The above files contain pom.xml which has overridden default maven plugins which avoids the problem of ClassNotFoundException for mysql connector
* Make sure the artifact is Web Application: Exploded

# Issues
* Best way to setup my maven architecture is to use the default structure and manually restructure the project folders
* [@Web annotation couldn't resolve](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26089902/webservlet-annotation-doesnt-work-with-tomcat-8)
    * min servlet-api version should be 3

# Credits
* Learned how to do these cool things from a [cool guy](https://www.udemy.com/user/chaddarby2/)
